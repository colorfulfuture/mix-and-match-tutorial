# A Tutorial on Mix-and-Match Perturbation 

***Note 1: Due to IP issues, we are not able to release the code for human motion prediction at the moment. As soon as IP issues resolve, we will update the repo with motion prediction code.***

***Note 2: This is an example of Mix-and-Match perturbation on MNIST dataset. This code contains all the building blocks of Mix-and-Match.***


## Task: Conditional image completion.
In this experiment, the goal is to complete MNIST digits given partial observations. Note that the conditioning signal is strong enough such that a deterministic model can generate a digit image given the condition.
